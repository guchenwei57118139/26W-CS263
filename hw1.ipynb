        "\n",
        "In this section, you'll implement the **generalized Scaled Dot-Product Self-Attention** mechanism as taught in the class. This is a core component of the Transformer model. This generalized version can accommodate encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder Transformer architectures, which means it supports cases where the lengths of the queries (Q) and key-value pairs (K, V) may **differ**. This is crucial for tasks like machine translation, where the encoder and decoder operate over sequences of different lengths.\n",

        "\n",
        "This mechanism takes four inputs: queries (Q), keys (K), values (V), and attention masks. It computes attention weights based on the dot product of Q and K, scaled by the square root of the dimensionality of the keys. This helps stabilize gradients and improve model performance. Once the attention weights are calculated, they are used to combine the values (V) into a weighted sum.\n",
